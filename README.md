## Intro
You just finished up your business trip and you've found out your flight has been cancelled due to the blizzard, so you're crashing at the motel just a couple miles away. It's not ideal, but it'll have to. Motels are only creepy in horror movies, right?

## Character Bios
**Jacob Fisher** is a 43-year-old corporate lawyer who's a father of 2. He's eager to get back to his family, after this exhausting business trip. Jacob was hoping to not be assigned to this trip, but got assigned anyway.

## Rough Plot
The game starts off with a cutscene of Jacob Fisher at the airport as he gets notified that his flight has been delayed due to the severe snow storm. Jacob is seen calling his wife and letting her know of the unfortunate news. From there, Jacob transitions from the airport scene to the lobby of the motel, where we see the guy at the front desk hand over the keys to his room. As the cut scene ends, the player takes the key being handed to him and starts to proceed to this room. Along the way, he notices a sinister undertone that the motel is giving off, specifically with the noises being heard from the rooms. Arriving at his room, the player enters and begins to settle in, only he doesn't realize what's in store for the night...

## Gameplay Description
This is an exploration game in a horror setting. The gameplay is centered around the player investigating the motel he's staying at, hoping to find the necessary items to survive the night.

## Artistic Style Outline
UI will be very minimal and simple, nothing fancy. Sound will be a lot like other horror games and movies. The level will be your classic old school motel. The maintenance of the establishment is obviously lacking, as shown by the deteriorating wallpaper and flickering lights, for example. The classic horror movie set at a motel is essentially what we're going for here. The setting is a major component in selling the game's impersion. It will leave the player constantly feeling on-edge and unsafe throughout the game.
